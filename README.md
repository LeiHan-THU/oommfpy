# OOMMFPy

A very minimal and simple Python library to read and extract data from OOMMF
magnetisation files `omf`. In addition to this library we provide tools to plot
`omf` files and convert them to `vtk` files.

## Install

A `setup.py` file is provided to install this library using `pip`

    git clone https://github.com/davidcortesortuno/oommfpy
    cd oommfpy
    pip install ./

If successful, the `plot_omf` and `omf2vtk` tools are installed in the
corresponding `bin` directory and can be called from the command line.

## TODO

- [ ] Multiple tests
- [ ] More options to plotting library
- [ ] Point data at cell centres of VTK file
